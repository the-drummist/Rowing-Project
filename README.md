# Rowing Capstone  

## Integrated Software  
None of the software has been tested yet. It will only run on a raspberry pi.  
The software for testing is outlined in data_collection.py and devices.py  
Parts of devices.py and all of hrcalc.py are modified from a 3rd party library due to time constraints.

| EMG Graph                     | A line graph of the EMG reading for the most recent workout. the graphs background is green in the safe range and red in the dangerous range |
| Pulse Graph                   | A line graph of the Pulse reading for the most recent workout. [Calculate](http://diet.mayoclinic.org/diet/move/how-to-measure-exercise-intensity?xid=nl_MayoClinicDiet_20160523) based on age the ideal zone for someone during a workout. The ideal zone is green, and anything above and below it is red. |
| SpO2 Graph                    | A line graph of the SpO2 reading for the most recent workout.  The ideal zone is green (88% to 92%), anything below it is red and anything above it is yellow. |
| Calculated Shear Loding Graph | A line graph calculated by smoothing out the EMG reading and mapping it to corresponding force values (experimental) |
| Calculated Intensity Graph    | A line graph calculated by the equation ```MET's = (15.3 * (MHR/RHR)) / 3.5``` (Alex Kramer spent forever finding information and deriving this equation (:  |
| Calories Burned Calculation   | The Number of Calories Burned during the Workout. [Calculated](https://burned-calories.com/heart-rate) based on age, weight, and heart rate | 
| Calculated Progress Graph     | A line graph containing the average of each component from each workout plotted |
